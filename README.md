# EctoPerfecto

Practice Ecto queries, schema creation, and more using the [Chinook Database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database).

## Setup
Run `./setup.sh` to install dependencies and to seed your database.

## Exercises

* Create a schema for `albums` and `artists`
* Associate both
* Insert a new artist
* Insert a new album for that artist
* Create a changeset on artist that doesn't allow you to insert an artist with an empty name.

## Resetting
If you bork your db, you can run `./reset.sh` to bring everything back to normal.
